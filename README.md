# Fassos Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes the operational data of Fassos, a food delivery service, to gain insights into customer preferences, driver efficiency, order patterns, and ingredient optimization.

## Goals of Data Analysis

1. Understand customer preferences regarding ingredients in their orders.
2. Evaluate driver efficiency and identify areas for improvement.
3. Analyze order patterns to optimize delivery schedules and staffing.
4. Optimize ingredient usage to reduce waste and operational costs.

## Insights Drawn from the Project

1. **Customer Behavior Insights:**
   - Majority of customers prefer to either include extras or exclude certain ingredients in their rolls rather than opting for the default options.
   - There's a significant number of repeat customers who have consistently made changes to their orders in the past.

2. **Driver Efficiency Insights:**
   - Drivers have varying average times to pick up orders from the headquarters, indicating potential areas for training or operational improvements.
   - Analyzing successful order delivery percentages helps identify top-performing drivers and those who may need additional support or training.

3. **Order Patterns and Preferences:**
   - Peak ordering hours are observed in the evening, suggesting a higher demand during dinner hours. This insight can guide staffing and resource allocation.
   - Orders with both exclusions and extras are relatively common, highlighting the importance of flexibility in menu offerings.

4. **Ingredient Optimization:**
   - Understanding which ingredients are most frequently included or excluded allows for better inventory management and menu planning.
   - By optimizing ingredient usage, Fassos can potentially reduce waste and operational costs.

5. **Operational Efficiency Gains:**
   - Insights into delivery times and distances traveled help optimize delivery routes and improve overall efficiency.
   - Identifying trends such as delivery speed and duration provides actionable insights for enhancing service levels and customer satisfaction.

6. **Goals Achieved:**
   - Improved customer experience through personalized orders and efficient service.
   - Enhanced driver performance and operational efficiency through data-driven decision-making.
   - Better resource utilization and cost savings through optimized ingredient usage and delivery logistics.

7. **Future Directions:**
   - Implement real-time analytics to monitor and adjust operations dynamically.
   - Explore predictive analytics to anticipate customer preferences and optimize inventory management further.
   - Expand analysis to include customer feedback data for a more comprehensive view of service quality and customer satisfaction.
